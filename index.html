                A woman of paradoxes. Light and bubbly, also full of gravitas. I act my age and also like a grandma (I knit my own jumpers). And I throw a hell of a dinner party. <br>
                <p></p>
                I decided to go back to school to join the evolution of ethics in marketing. Wouldn't it be wonderful to grow up in a world where media and advertising didn't drag down your self-esteem by telling you that you ought to look like the airbrused models they espouse?<br>
                <p></p>
                Yeah. That'd be pretty awesome.

                <strong>Photography</strong>
                <br>
                About 5 years ago, I treated myself to a DSLR (Nikon D5200, for those familiar with the industry). I've taken it on trips through national parks, to capture moments from other vacations, and to film and photograph my old a cappella groups!

                <strong>Music</strong>
                <br>
                While I was forced into learning piano as a child, it formed the basis of all my knowledge and skill in music. Early on, I began to accompany myself while singing, and began playing guitar. Then it was composing and teaching a cappella music for multiple groups over 13 years (oh my, almost half my life I've done a cappella?!). <br>
                These days, I get my music fix as a part of the LSE choir!

                <strong>Student Ambassador</strong>
                <br>
              I was selected to be a Student Ambassador for the Department of Management while at LSE, with my particular focus to be on blogging. Every day, I search for an experience that I can write about passionately, and that will resonate with incoming and current students.
